# Java-Algorithm-Maze

Algorithm Maze made in Java without additional libraries by Dominic Jiang

## Contributor List:

1. Dominic Jiang for the production of the algorithm and algorithm development

## How To Test This Algorithm On Mac OS Or Windows

1. Download Maze.jar 

2. Make sure you have JVM downloaded if not find ways to download for your operating system

3. Open terminal and type java (space) -jar (space) and drag the executable jar file in and press enter 


4. And the algorithm should be ready to go


## Command Center

1. Type startSolving to solve a maze using BFS (Breath First Search Algorithm)

2. Type startMaking to make a maze using DFS (Depth First Search Algorithm)

3. Type exportTextMap to export a loadable maze for solving or keeping

4. Type importMap to import a maze to solve
